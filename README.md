## FAQ
### When the project will be updated ?
As soon as I got time and motivation to work on it :)
### Why Ionic ?
I just gave `Ionic` a try to work along with `Akita.js`

**For the moment, I think Ionic v4 is good at its job**

At the beginning, I faced up some problems with it and the documentation didn't help. Now in 2020, Ionic v4 got mature.
I'd like to add some stuff like a local database on device, we'll see if it fits good with `Akita.js`.

Note I also could have pick NativeScript or Flutter, maybe i'll give them a try later on.

### What about a Backend-side ?
Yeah that would be cool to have a tiny CRM.
I'm thinking about an architecture using NodeJs and some libs to get things done easily, though I wont work on it pretty soon.
