## FAQ
### When the project will be updated ?
As soon as I got time and motivation to work on it :)
### Why Ionic ?
I just gave Ionic a try to work along with Akita.js

For the moment, I'm not a big fan of Ionic. I faced up too many problems for this kind of framework, plus the documentation didn't help. I think it lacks of real world examples with the V4 version. Need to give Ionic's team more time.

Note I also could have pick NativeScript or Flutter, maybe it will change later (for a rewrite).

### What about a Backend-side ?
Yeah that would be cool to have a tiny CRM.
I'm thinking about an architecture using NodeJs and some libs to get things done easily, though I'm not sure to work on it pretty soon.
